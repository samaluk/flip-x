# frog log

Write a friction entry.

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | `string` | no | One line, specific enough to search for. |

## Environment Variables

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `EDITOR` | `string` | no |  | Editor opened for the body when running interactively. |
| `GH_TOKEN` | `string` | no |  | Fallback when GITHUB_TOKEN is unset. |
| `GITHUB_API_URL` | `string` | no |  | API base URL. Set automatically inside Actions. |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | `string` | no |  | Token used by --publish. |
| `VISUAL` | `string` | no |  | Overrides EDITOR when both are set. |

## Options

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--body` | `string` |  | Complete Markdown body. Must preserve this repository issue form when one exists. Also read from piped input, or from an editor when interactive. |
| `--cwd` | `string` |  | Directory to run in. Defaults to the working directory. |
| `--force` | `boolean` |  | Log it even if a similar entry already exists. |
| `--label` | `array` |  | Extra issue label. Repeatable. |
| `--open` | `boolean` |  | Open $EDITOR on the entry after writing it. |
| `--publish` | `boolean` |  | File the issue immediately instead of leaving it for `publish`. |
| `--severity` | `string` |  | Impact. Defaults to minor. |
| `--token` | `string` |  | GitHub token. Overrides the environment. |
| `--target` | `string` |  | Upstream npm package or GitHub repository as `owner/repo`. Omit for this repository. |

## Output

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `artifacts` | `string` | yes | Directory for reproduction files. Not created until something writes there. |
| `file` | `string` | yes | Path of the entry, relative to the repository root. |
| `id` | `string` | yes |  |
| `issue` | `string` | no | Linked issue, when --publish filed one. |
| `title` | `string` | yes |  |
| `unfiled` | `string` | no | Why --publish did not file an issue. The entry is written either way. |

## Examples

```sh
# Log friction in this repository
frog log 'pnpm test -- <files> ignores file filters'

# Log friction in an upstream library
frog log 'getBalance rejects a checksummed address' --severity major --target viem
```

> Run `frog list` first: this friction may already be recorded.
